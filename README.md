# Stock Market Prediction
1. Stock market is non-linear and volatile and it is very difficult to extract valuable information from patterns. The stock market is one of the most important institutions of any economy. 
2. In the past, several researchers have proposed innovative approaches to predict stock prices. Researchers have used Linear regression, Support Vector Machines, and traditional machine learning techniques for stock price prediction. The limitations of these approaches are that accuracy is not adequate. 
3. There is a need for a better approach that can predict high variations in prices with significant accuracy. 
4. In this project deep learning is applied to the stock index dataset to  predict stock prices. Experiment analysis has proved that accuracy is better as compared to existing approaches. The period from Apr 2017 to Apr 2022 is used for prediction. The dataset is taken from the Bombay Stock Exchange(B.S.E).
5. The deep learning model LSTM is used to predict stock prices. LSTM can save cell state in long-term dependencies. It can predict stock prices in an effective way as previous day stock prices can be saved. Input gate, Forget gate, and Output gate are used in LSTM for verifying previous states.
6. To further optimize the model another deep learning technique is used i.e. GRU. GRU is an efficient variant of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) widely used for sequential data tasks due to its effective information management with fewer parameters compared to alternatives like LSTM. Experimental analysis has proved that GRU is better than LSTM.
7. For further optimization an  Autoregressive model is used i.e. ARIMA, which stands for Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average. It is a widely used time series forecasting method that combines autoregressive (AR) and moving average (MA) components with differencing to model and predict time-dependent data. ARIMA is a versatile and powerful tool for analyzing and forecasting various time series, making it valuable in fields such as finance, economics, and epidemiology.
